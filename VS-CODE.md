# VSCODE - IDE


### VSCODE FEATURES
---
##### These are the some features of VSCODE

#### 1. IntelliSense 

##### Meet IntelliSense.
Go beyond syntax highlighting and autocomplete with IntelliSense, which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.

#### 2. Debug

##### Print statement debugging is a thing of the past.
Debug code right from the editor. Launch or attach to your running apps and debug with break points, call stacks, and an interactive console.

#### 3. Built in GIT

##### Git commands built-in.
Working with Git and other SCM providers has never been easier. Review diffs, stage files, and make commits right from the editor. Push and pull from any hosted SCM service.

#### 4. Extensions

##### Extensible and customizable.
Want even more features? Install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and to connect to additional services. Extensions run in separate processes, ensuring they won't slow down your editor.

#### 3. Code Spell Checker
The goal of this spell checker is to help with catching common spelling errors while keeping the number of false positives low.

Load a TypeScript, JavaScript, Text, etc.. file. Words not in the dictionary files will have a squiggly underline.

#### 4. Color Picker
Helper with GUI to generate color codes such as CSS color notations.
And, a command Convert Color to change the color notation.

A dialog box is shown by pressing Alt + C P keys or command Pick Color. If a cursor is positioned on a string that is color notation at that time, that string is selected as target for editing.

#### 7. GitLens
GitLens is an open-source extension for Visual Studio Code created by Eric Amodio.

GitLens simply helps you better understand code. Quickly glimpse into whom, why, and when a line or code block was changed. Jump back through history to gain further insights as to how and why the code evolved. Effortlessly explore the history and evolution of a codebase.

While GitLens is powerful and feature rich, it is also highly customizable to meet your specific needs — find code lens intrusive or the current line blame annotation distracting — no problem, it is quick and easy to turn them off or change how they behave via the built-in GitLens Settings editor, an interactive editor covering many of GitLens' powerful settings. While for more advanced customizations, refer to the GitLens settings docs and edit your vscode user settings.

##### Here are just some of the features that GitLens provides,

* an unobtrusive current line blame annotation at the end of the line with detailed blame information accessible via hovers
* on-demand gutter blame annotations, including a heatmap, for the whole file
* authorship code lens showing the most recent commit and # of authors to the top of files and/or on code blocks
* on-demand gutter heatmap annotations to show how recently lines were changed, relative to all the other changes in the file and to now (hot vs. cold)
* on-demand recent changes annotations to highlight lines changed by the most recent commit
* a status bar blame annotation showing author and date for the current line
* many rich Side Bar views
    * a Repositories view to visualize, navigate, and explore Git repositories
    * a File History view to visualize, navigate, and explore the revision history of the current file
    * a Line History view to visualize, navigate, and explore the revision history of the selected lines of current file
    * a Search Commits view to search and explore commit histories by message, author, files, id, etc
    * a Compare view to visualize comparisons between branches, tags, commits, and more
* many powerful commands for exploring commits and histories, comparing and navigating revisions, stash access, repository status, etc
* user-defined modes for quickly toggling between sets of settings
* and so much more
